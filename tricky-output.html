Replacing https://ðŸš€-science.com/science with https://science.wordpress.com in the input.

<p>
	<!-- Inline URLs are migrated -->
	science.wordpress.com has the best scientific articles on the internet! We're also
	available via the punycode URL:
	
	<!-- No problem handling HTML-encoded punycode URLs with urlencoded characters in the path -->
	https://science.wordpress.com/.
	
	<!-- Correctly ignores similarâ€“butâ€“different URLs -->
	This isn't migrated: https://ðŸš€-science.comcast/science <br>
	Or this: super-ðŸš€-science.com/science

<!-- Block attributes are migrated without any issue -->
<!-- wp:image {"src":"https:\/\/science.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/image.png"} -->
<!-- As are URI HTML attributes -->
<img src="https://science.wordpress.com/wp-content/image.png">
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- Non-URL attributes are not migrated. -->
<span class="https://ðŸš€-science.com/science"></span>

<!-- This also has downsides, we may need to refine the attribute migration rules to account for this: -->
<button data-url="It's so great on https://ðŸš€-science.com/science">Hello!</button>
